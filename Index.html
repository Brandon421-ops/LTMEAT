        The night I found LTBEEF, 231 days ago, I was hyped. I shared it, went
        to sleep, and woke up to dozens of pings. Disable an admin extension so
        easily? It was unheard of. It spread across the internet, got sysadmins
        in a scramble, and took an absurdly long time to get patched. Everything
        a good exploit should do.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        I thought LTBEEF was as easy as it got. I thought Chrome had gotten too
        secure to have any more simple exploits. I was wrong.

      <p class="text">
        LTBEEF truly disabled extensions. Unsurprisingly, it's really hard to
        fully disable an extension when you aren't supposed to be able to.
        Admin-installed extensions can only be disabled by other admin-installed
        extensions or components that use the
        <code>chrome.management</code> API. The Chrome Web Store had this
        permission and was treated like a normal webpage, which was the weakest
        link that LTBEEF took advantage of. There was also a variation for
        Inspect Element users which involved directly running code on a
        long-forgotten component extension. So truly disabling extensions is
        really hard.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        In fact, LTMEAT (the new exploit I found) doesn't fully disable
        extensions.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <i>Well, what else can you do?</i> one may ask.
        <i>If the extension isn't disabled, that means it's running, right?</i>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        To answer that question, we have to get into Chrome's process
        management, extension runtime, internal debug URLs, and more. Let's get
        started.

      <p class="title">Hanging and killing (kid-friendly material, trust me)</p>
      <p class="text">
        JavaScript is cool. The web runs on JavaScript, in case you weren't
        aware. That means, of course, that Chrome does too. The people working
        over at Google HQ (yuck, California) and other web browser devs have to
        worry about limiting JavaScript. For example, what do you do when a
        website uses too much of it?
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Well, browsers like Chrome don't want to lag out the entire browser and
        definitely not its user's whole computer, so they give each tab a
        certain amount of memory. When it's working at full blast, the browser
        will
        <b>hang</b> the site. This means that the page will become unresponsive
        as it waits for the JavaScript to finish. You can try this yourself by
        running an infinite loop on any page:
      </p>
      <code>for(;;)1</code>
      <p class="text">
        Chrome also limits tabs in terms of actual memory used. Once JavaScript
        starts using more memory than Chrome can afford, the tab will be
        <b>killed</b>. It's not loading, there's no chance of it being
        responsive again--it's just dead. This kind of behavior can also be
        triggered by a <b>crash</b>, which is self-explanatory and has a similar
        effect. You can see this for yourself by running code to create an Array
        with 4,294,967,295 elements in it, as seen below. Talk about overkill!
        (pun intended)
      </p>
      <code>[...Array(2**32-1)]</code>
      <img src="/img/crash.png" />
      <p class="text">
        To recap, hanging is when a tab freezes and becomes unresponsive because
        it's actively running intense JavaScript. Killing is when a tab is
        crashed because the browser decides that it's using far too much memory.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="title">Diseases and handshakes</p>
      <p class="text">
        Time for a thinking activity (that sounds Orwellian, lol). Imagine every
        tab on your computer as a person. These people (tabs) are all at a party
        or some other public gathering.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Normally, tabs are completely seperated. But when a tab opens a tab with
        its same domain, those two tabs share memory. We can imagine this by
        imagining two people at the party shaking hands. When one of them gets
        sick, the other also gets sick. When one gets electrocuted, the other
        also gets electrocuted, and so on. You can simulate this by running the
        following code on a page...
      </p>
      <code>open(location.href)</code>
      <p class="text">
        ...then using the hang or kill codes (scroll up) on either page. When it
        crashes or freezes, the other tab will be taken with it. This is because
        they're shaking hands, or in technical terms, because they are using the
        same memory process in Chrome.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/party.png" />
      <p class="text">
        <i>So why does any of this matter?</i> you may wonder.
        <i>Why do I need to know so much about how Chrome freezes its tabs?</i>
      </p>
      <p class="text">Finally, it's time to get to the point of the exploit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <p class="title">The deadly group hug</p>
      <p class="text">
        This exploit stops extensions (including admin-enforced ones such as web
        filters) from working until a Chromebook is restarted. But to understand
        how, we need to talk about a little quirk in the tab party situation.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Chrome Extensions are made of a group of files. So what?
        <b>
          Chrome sees these files as tabs, and it runs of them in the same
          process, sharing memory.
        </b>
        This can be imagined as a group hug. When one person is electrocuted,
        they all are. When one tab crashes, the whole extension crashes.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/hug.png" />
      <p class="text">
        <i>Ah,</i> exclaims the average Joe.
        <i>
          I get the point. You're going to kill one of the extension tabs. Then
          the extension will go away. I'm so smart!
        </i>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Come on, Google isn't <i>that</i> stupid. When an admin extension
        crashes, it recovers within three seconds or so. There's no good way to
        automate crashing it, and it just lags your computer insanely hard when
        you try. Plus, we want a semi-permanent exploit.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <i>Oh,</i> he says.
        <i>
          Then we just hang it. I see it now! You hang one, and the rest of the
          files don't run any scripts.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Yeah, that's 100% correct. When you hang an extension page, the whole
        extension stops functioning. But there is an issue. Web filter
        extensions like GoGuardian and Securly work by using the
        <code>chrome.webRequest</code> API, where they add listeners to every
        request you send.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        This means that your browser waits for those extensions to respond
        before it loads any website. Since the extensions are hanging, they
        can't respond. And you can't load any websites.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        While trying to fix this issue, I accidentally stumbled upon a way to
        basically stop the extension's entire runtime until a restart.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Before I get into this, I'd like to re-state my absolute astonishment
        that Chrome still has bugs like this in 2023, and that nobody else has
        noticed them. This should have been discovered and patched in 2018 or
        2019 at the latest.

        Three Chrome "features" put together make this exploit insanely
        convenient.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>FEATURE ONE:</b> There is a small gap between when an extension
        starts loading and its pages start initializing. So, in theory,
        <b>if you managed to restart an extension and instantly hang it</b>,
        none of its pages would load, meaning none of its listeners would load.
        Then Chrome wouldn't try to communicate with it and you could actually
        browse with web filter extensions disabled.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>FEATURE TWO:</b> An extension's background page
        (<code>_generated_background_page.html</code>) ties everything together
        and is loaded first. If you hang an extension page before the background
        page has loaded, all the other parts of the extension won't be able to
        load either.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/chart.png" />
      <p class="text">
        And in fact, this means you can even close the tab you messed with (at
        the top), since the background tab stays frozen and keeps the whole
        extension broken.

        <code>chrome://kill</code> and <code>chrome://hang</code> can be entered

        assumed that it wouldn't cause any damage. I literally do not know what
        the software engineers are doing at their headquarters.

      <p class="title" id="exploit">The meaty stuff (instructions)</p>
      <p>
        <a href="/alt/1.txt" target="_blank" class="button">
          Alternate Method #1 (easier)
        </a>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        The method linked above involves less spamming. It doesn't work for all
        extensions, but it should work for your filter. However, it's also
        easier to block. <b> The original instructions are shown below. </b>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>STEP ONE:</b> Find a page belonging to the extension you want to
        disable. You'll need your extension's 32-character ID to continue. If
        you're trying to bypass stuff, try finding it in a
        <a href="/ids.txt" target="_blank">filter extension ID list</a>. For
        further help, check the <a href="#help">help section</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Once you have the ID, you'll be guaranteed to get to a working
        <code>chrome-extension://</code> page by visiting the manifest file:
        (with your extension's ID substituted in, of course)
      </p>
      <code>chrome-extension://extension_id_here_please/manifest.json</code>
      <p class="text">
        Some extensions' pages are much easier to access directly (like their
        options or block pages). All that's important is that you open a page
        belonging to the extension you want to disable.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>STEP TWO:</b> Bookmark the extension page (bookmark A) if you wish.
        Then, bookmark <code>chrome://kill</code> (B) and
        <code>chrome://hang</code> (C).
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>STEP THREE:</b> While on the extension page (A), click the
        <code>chrome://kill</code> bookmark (B). The page should crash. You
        should already have the next step prepared.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>STEP FOUR:</b> Instantly start spamming
        <code>chrome://hang</code> (bookmark C) and quickly
        <b>reload the page while spamming</b> using the refresh key on your
        keyboard (or less ideally, ctrl+R). You should have reloaded within one
        or two seconds of killing the page.
      </p>
      <p class="text">A timeline of the exploit can be seen below:</p>
      <img src="/img/line.png" />
      <p class="text">
        If you are unable to visit the extension page (bookmark A) after trying
        the exploit, then LTMEAT worked!
        <i>Please</i> read the <a href="#help">help section</a> if you had an
        issue (for example, if no sites seem to load). You can restore
        extensions by signing out and back into your Chromebook.

      <img src="/img/gru.png" />
      <p class="text">
        Note that the steps above are by no means the only way to perform the
        exploit. I'll add the first alternate set of instructions on May 11th
        for people affected by patches.

        Turns out that I had far too much faith in society when making this
        page. Some of you skids out there are really, <i>really</i> stupid and
        also can't read. So here are the answers to some commonly asked
        questions.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>How do I get an extension ID?</b>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Okay, fair. Extension IDs are leaked in a couple of places. Generally,
        the best way to get them is to go to extension settings and copy the URL
        query value as shown in the video below:
      </p>
      <video controls>
        <source src="/img/vid.webm" type="video/webm" />
      </video>
      <p class="text">
        If you're actually competent in dealing with JSON, you can easily find
        IDs in
        <code>chrome://extensions-internals</code> too, as well as another
        similar URL.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>It says blocked by client?</b>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        That's the message you get when you try to visit an a page belonging to
        an extension that doesn't exist. The error message
        (<code>ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT</code>) is extremely misleading. Nobody
        blocked it--you just need to find the right extension ID (see above).
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        If you got this because you tried to visit the
        <code>extension_id_here_please</code> example URL, you should be
        extremely ashamed of yourself. Please change and grow as a person.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>I don't have a bookmarks bar!!!!</b>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        First, try running ctrl+shift+B. If that doesn't work, go to
        <code>chrome://settings</code> and turn on the "home button" feature,
        then set it to <code>chrome://hang</code>. A home icon should show up to
        the right of your refresh icon in the top left. Use that instead of
        bookmark C.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        If that doesn't work, try the
        <a href="https://ltmeat.bypassi.com/alt/1.txt" target="_blank"
          >first alternate method</a
        >. It should work for most web filters, but I can't guarantee that it
        can disable every extension. I'll try to add more alternate methods
        soon.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>I disabled an extension but now I can't load websites!</b>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        If you actually just read the writeup, you'd know that this would happen
        if the extension's background page loaded and its listeners were already
        initialized before you used <code>chrome://hang</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Anyway, no listeners means <b>you were too slow</b>. Either you waited
        more than three seconds between bookmark B and reloading the page, or
        you weren't spamming bookmark C fast enough. The most reliable fix for
        this is to just restart your computer and try again. Try to match the
        pace of the gif below: (note the reload)
      </p>
      <img src="/img/abc.gif" />
      <p class="text">
        Note how the name of the extension doesn't show in the URL bar after the
        start, because I didn't let the extension (and thus its listeners) load
        between bookmarks B and C. Again, the
        <a href="/img/line.png" target="_blank">timeline</a> is a good
        visualization of this.
      </p>

        <b>The bookmarks don't do anything when I click them!</b>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Might be admin-blocked. Either be smart enough to figure out another
        way, or check this site daily to see if new alternate instructions have
        been posted.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        <b>I disabled the extension, why is some stuff still blocked?</b>
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        I have bad news for you... not all filters are Chrome Extensions. And
        again, make sure the extension pages (like bookmark A) are frozen before
        you assume that your skiddy self successfully did the exploit.
